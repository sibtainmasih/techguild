## Control Structures (continue...)

### Ternary condition Operator

* Syntax:

```python
x = val1 if condition else val2
```

**Q.** Write a program to take age input from user and print status. If age >18 adult otherwise kid.

```python
age = int(input("Enter age: "))

# if age>=18:
#     status="adult"
# else:
#    status="Kid"

status = "Adult" if age>=18 else "Kid"

print(f"You are - {status}")

```

### If Conditions (Best Practices)

* Writing range conditions

```python
b=10

if 10 <= b <= 50:
    print("b is in the range 10 to 50.")
```

* Writing conditions in readable way - applicable if you want to make a decision based on value is present or not.

```python

students = ['A', 'B', 'C']

# working code
if len(students)>0:
    print("Conduct Session")
else:
    print("No Session")

# better code
if students:
    print("Conduct session")
else:
    print("No session")

````

* Comparing a `bool` is not required.

```python
is_raining=True

# working code
if is_raining == True:
    print("Football")
else:
    print("Cricket")

# better code
if is_raining:
    print("Football")
else:
    print("Cricket")
```

* If condition is too long, assign it to a variable. Name the variable appropriately and pass that to if condition.

```python
students = ['A', 'B', 'C']
is_raining=True

playing_condition=(students and not is_raining)

if playing_condition:
    print("Let's go to the playing ground.")
else:
    print("No session.")
```

Note:

* If the condition statement has logical `and` operator, then python evaluates the conditions till first condition gives `False`. And then it skips the rest.
* If the condition statement has logical `or` operator, then python evaluates the conditions till first condition gives `True`. And then it skips the rest.

### while Loop

* While loop in Python can have an optional `else` block.
* The statements in `else` block will execute if the loop doesn't terminate because of a `break`.

Syntax:

```python
while condition:
    statement(s)
else:
    statement(s)
```

Example: Print squares of numbers between 1 to 10.

```python
num=1
while num<=10:
    print(f"Square of {num} = {num**2}")
    num+=1
```
* `break` statement is used to terminate the loop based on some conditions.

```python
num=1
while num<=10:
    if num**2>75:
        break
    print(f"Square of {num} = {num**2}")    
    num+=1

# Output 
Square of 1 = 1
Square of 2 = 4
Square of 3 = 9
Square of 4 = 16
Square of 5 = 25
Square of 6 = 36
Square of 7 = 49
Square of 8 = 64
```

* `continue` statement is used to jump to next pass of the loop.

```python
# Q. Print squares of numbers divisible by 3 between 1 to 10.
num=0
while num<=10:
    num+=1
    if num%3 !=0:
        continue
    print(f"Square of {num} = {num**2}")

# Output
Square of 3 = 9
Square of 6 = 36
Square of 9 = 81
```

#### Guess the Number game
 
**Q.** Create "Guess the Number" game in Python. The rules are as follows.

* There is a random number generated by the program. 
* The user has to guess the number in 5 attempts. 
* The game ends if -

	* User guess the number correctly - user wins!
	* User exhausts all 5 attempts - try again!
	* User enters -1.

**Soulution:** [number_guessing.py](number_guessing.py)

In the above solution, do check -

* How effective it is to use `else` block of `while` loop.
* How to generate a random integer in Python


### for..in Loop

* `for..in` loop can be used to iterate over any iterable.

```python
# Iterating elements in a list
>>> students = ["A", "B", "C", "D"]
>>> for s in students:
...     print(f"Hello {s}!")
... 
Hello A!
Hello B!
Hello C!
Hello D!


# Iterating characters in a string
>>> for c in "TechGuild":
...     print (c)
... 
T
e
c
h
G
u
i
l
d
```

* Use `enumerate` to get index along with element of the iterable.

```python
>>> for idx, c in enumerate("TechGuild"):
...     print(f"{c} is at index position {idx}.")
... 
T is at index position 0.
e is at index position 1.
c is at index position 2.
h is at index position 3.
G is at index position 4.
u is at index position 5.
i is at index position 6.
l is at index position 7.
d is at index position 8.
```

## Data Structures (continue...)

### Tuple

* Tuple is same as list but it is *immutable*.

```python
# You can modify a list as it is mutable.
>>> students = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']
>>> students[0] = 'Alice'
>>> students
['Alice', 'B', 'C', 'D']

# You can't modify a tuple as it is immutable.
>>> students = ('A', 'B', 'C', 'D')
>>> students[0]
'A'
>>> students[0] = 'Alice'
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
```

* Tuple is more efficient than list.

* Different ways to create a tuple - 

```python
# Use round brackets to create a tuple
>>> t = (1, 3, 5)
>>> type(t)
<class 'tuple'>

# Syntactic sugar - as round brackets are optional
>>> t = 1, 3, 5
>>> type(t)
<class 'tuple'>

# Create a tuple from a string
>>> tuple('TechGuild')
('T', 'e', 'c', 'h', 'G', 'u', 'i', 'l', 'd')

# Convert a list into tuple
>>> students = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']
>>> tuple(students)
('A', 'B', 'C', 'D')
```

* To create a tuple with single element, add `,` at the end.

```
# Adding brackets doesn't make it tuple with single element.
>>> x = (1)
>>> type(x)
<class 'int'>

# Add comma after the element to make it a tuple with single element
>>> x = (1,)
>>> type(x)
<class 'tuple'>

# Another way (without round brackets)
>>> x = 1
>>> type(x)
<class 'int'>

# Comma makes it tuple. Be careful!
>>> x = 1,
>>> type(x)
<class 'tuple'>

```

* Tuple packing and un-packing

```python
# Tuple packing - is multiple elements into a tuple
>>> rec = 90, 'Ebaad', 26
>>> rec
(90, 'Ebaad', 26)

# Tuple unpacking - is opening the tuple and assigning each element to a variable>>> roll_number, name, age = rec
>>> roll_number
90
>>> name
'Ebaad'
>>> age
26

# If the values don't match variables, it causes exception
# E.g. there are 3 values in tuple and you just provided two variables.
>>> rec
(90, 'Ebaad', 26)
>>> name, age = rec
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ValueError: too many values to unpack (expected 2)

# To hold all the remaining values in a tuple into last variable, use *
>>> rec
(90, 'Ebaad', 26)
>>> roll, *stud = rec
>>> roll
90
>>> stud
['Ebaad', 26]

```

### `sorted` function

* It is used to sort an iterable (list, tuple, etc.)

```python
>>> n = [10, 7, 4, 9, 100, 5]

>>> sorted(n)
[4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 100]
```

* Set `reverse=True` to sort in reverse order.

```python
# sort in reverse order
>>> sorted(n, reverse=True)
[100, 10, 9, 7, 5, 4]
```

* You can also sort based on a different `key`. E.g. to sort based on number of digits -

```python
>>> im = [97, 91, 1003, 10, 20, 100, 98, 10000, 1000, 999]

>>> sorted(im)
[10, 20, 91, 97, 98, 100, 999, 1000, 1003, 10000]

>>> sorted(im, key=lambda x:len(str(x)))
[97, 91, 10, 20, 98, 100, 999, 1003, 1000, 10000]
```

* **sorted** vs. **list.sort** 

	* `sorted` works on any iterable (list, tuple etc.) and returns a **new** sorted list.
	* `sort` is a list function and it modifies the **existing** list by sorting it.

```python
>>> im = [97, 91, 1003, 10, 20, 100, 98, 10000, 1000, 999]
>>> sorted(im)
[10, 20, 91, 97, 98, 100, 999, 1000, 1003, 10000]
>>> im
[97, 91, 1003, 10, 20, 100, 98, 10000, 1000, 999]
>>> im.sort()
>>> im
[10, 20, 91, 97, 98, 100, 999, 1000, 1003, 10000]
```

* If it is string, then it sorts in lexical order.

```python
>>> l = ["India", "Pakistan", "China", "Oman", "Muscat", "Dubai"]
>>> sorted(l)
['China', 'Dubai', 'India', 'Muscat', 'Oman', 'Pakistan']


# Sort in reverse order of name length
>>> sorted(l, reverse=True, key=lambda x:len(x))
['Pakistan', 'Muscat', 'India', 'China', 'Dubai', 'Oman']
```

x,y = y, x+y
```

5. Write a program to take 10 integer values input from user and store them in a list. 
	
	1. Check if all the elements in the list are same.
	2. Create a new list with elements at even index positions.
