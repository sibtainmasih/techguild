Contact Book Application
-------------------------

John is a Financial Advisor in a top investment bank on Wall Street. As part of his job, he meets multiple clients daily.

John is finding it difficult to maintain contact details of all the clients manually in a *Contact Book*. 

The activites that he performs are as follows.

1. For each of the clients, John jots down name, address, city, contact number and email address. 
2. John writes date with client record which tells him when first he met that client. 
3. As he interacts with a client, he keeps track of when he last called/met the client and for what reason.
4. When it comes to contacting a client, the contact book becomes very handy to get client details.
5. When John visits any city, he will scan his contact book to find all the clients in that city to ensure he meets them and discuss business with them.
6. John keeps client records updated in the contact book.
7. If a client information gets entirely stale, John would just mark the record with a cross. 

>_Think like John and add more use cases._
 
Help John with a **command line Python application** to manage the _Contact Book_.
